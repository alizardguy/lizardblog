## The flood
I wanted to work more on my WIP Godot game, but it has been a chaotic two days with my room being mildly flooded last night. 

### How did your room get flooded idiot?
Surprisingly this is not my fault at all, someone in my household left a sink on for possibly hours in the room next to me and all the water went downhill through the wall into my room. It was a slow realization as I was playing VR after I helped clean up the water that made it into the halls, I felt a wet spot below my foot and noticed everywhere I put pressure started filling with water.

### No more floor!
Sadly to clean up the mass amount of water we have to fully remove my room's floor, meaning I am currently writing this from ontop of the house's concrete foundation. 

## DNS
I have spent what is left of today after work playing around with web urls. As you may notice this site's url is "blog.alizardguy.com", the **blog** section of the url is what is known as a "sub domain". I have recently been playing around with giving sub domains sub domains and I made a very long domain:


[http://hey.guys.youll.never.guess.my.current.hyper.fixation.guys.alizardguy.com](http://hey.guys.youll.never.guess.my.current.hyper.fixation.guys.alizardguy.com) (https pending...)

## Closing out
I wanted this blog post to be longer but my energy is spent so I am going to call it in for the night, thank you for reading as always!!!
