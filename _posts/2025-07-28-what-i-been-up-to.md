Sorry I havenâ€™t posted in around.. 9 months.. Here is a scattered collection of what I have been up to in the past 9 months.
# YouTube
In May I uploaded a [video](https://youtu.be/U8ztd_7Y2mw?si=9OBhcLvGgiieXNOc) stating my intention to create 21 videos before the end of 2025. Currently I have uploaded 6, with the [most popular video](https://youtu.be/PF59CLMJT3Q?si=Vl50E0yb3cboT7sN) reaching 2.3K views. The year is rapidly apporaching it's end I to keep pace I need to significantly increase my video output rate. Currently I been uploading random Minecraft videos, but I hope to soon pivot to more high effort stuff. (It just been slow remembering how to speak)
# Godot
I am still working on a secret Godot game that I will hopefully reveal at a later date... ðŸ¤«
# PokÃ©mon
I once again have returned to trying to catch every single Pokemon, my goal is to finish this quest before the new [Pokemon Champions](https://champions.pokemon.com/en-us/) game releases. I may make a blog post later talking about this in more detail.
# Monthly blog posts
That's all for this post! In an effort to more consistently post, I am going to try to release a monthly "Month In Review" blogpost to archive moments of my life.
