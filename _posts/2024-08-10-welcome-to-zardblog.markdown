# It's alive!!!
Lizard blog v2 should now be running! My next goal will be to setup the subdomain and to get a basic theme running.

# Places I am
- [My Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/alizardguy.com)
- [My Twitter](https://x.com/alizardguy)

# My plans for this site
I plan to build out the main [alizardguy.com](https://alizardguy.com/) and blog.alizardguy.com as two seperate codebases that reference eachother, this blog will likely be updated much more often than the main site.
